# RE_Shiki2MAL

This project was created to synchronize watched anime and read manga between two resources Shikimori and Myanimelist. (But for now it's one way. Shikimori to Myanimelist)

Documentation, instructions, etc. will be available in the near future.

Support for other resources is planned, such as Anilist, Kitsu.
